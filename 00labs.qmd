What are the Labs about?

Lab | Topics | Old Labs?
----: | ---------------------------- | -------
[Lab 1](lab1.qmd) | Can you build a data viz with Quarto and submit it to us successfully? Can you compare two regressions fit to a training sample and a validation sample? | 2022 Lab 2 Question 1 is viz, 2022 Lab 2 Question 4 could be adapted to part 2 here
[Lab 2](lab2.qmd) | Can you use survey weights to complete some sort of inference, can you fit a two-way ANOVA model with interaction? | ANOVA is 2022 Lab 1 Question 2, Survey Weights is from 2022 Quiz 2
[Lab 3](lab3.qmd) | Can you build a linear regression model using non-linear terms with `ols` and Spearman $\rho^2$? | This is basically 2022 Lab 3 Part B
[Lab 4](lab4.qmd) | Can you build a simple logistic model and use it to make predictions, and then can you build a more complex logistic regression model with non-linear terms, and compare it to a main effects fit? | Simple model is 2022 Lab 2 Question 5. Complex model is essentially 2022 Lab 3 Part A
[Lab 5](lab5.qmd) | Can you build a Table 1, and can you use results from a lasso approach to select predictors and evaluate results against a validation sample? | Table 1 is 2022 Lab 1 Question 1, LASSO is from 2022 Quiz 2
[Lab 6](lab6.qmd) | Can you run and describe a Kaplan-Meier curve, and can you complete a regression on a count outcome? | K-M is sort of Lab 6 Q5 (without requiring log rank test) Count is Lab 4 Q4
[Lab 7](lab7.qmd) | Can you run and describe regression results from an ordinal outcome, and use multiple imputation in a logistic model? | Ordinal is Lab 4 Q3, MI is from 2022 Quiz 2
[Lab 8](lab8.qmd) | Can you fit and describe a Cox model with cpm and then can you use tidymodels to assess a linear model | Tidymodels is part of 2022 Lab 5, Cox is part of 2022 Lab 6 questions 2-4
